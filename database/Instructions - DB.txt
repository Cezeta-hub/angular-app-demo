		  DATABASE CREATION	
</// ------------------------------------------- ///>

This project's database is created and managed using EntityFramework.

This means that we will create all the tables and fill in the seeded data automatically using
the different migrations set on the back-end side. For now we only need to create an empty DB
named "CEZ_AngularDemoDB" on your local server.

A simple "CREATE DATABASE CEZ_AngularDemoDB;" will suffice (a sql script file is also provided,
for ease of use).

After that is done, go to the backend to continue the configuration.
